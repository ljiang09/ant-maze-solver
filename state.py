def generate_pheromone_layer(rows, cols, num_exits=2):
    '''
    Generates a pheromone layer for the maze.

    Accessible cells in the maze are represented by 0, while walls are
    represented by -1.

    For each accessible cell in the maze, the value of the cell
    represents the amount of pheromone present.

    Args:
        rows (int): Number of rows in the maze.
        cols (int): Number of columns in the maze.
        num_exits (int): Number of exits to create in the maze.
            Must be more than 2 for a maze to actually work.

    Returns:
        A 2D list of ints representing the maze, where -1 indicates
        a wall and 0 indicates a valid path.
