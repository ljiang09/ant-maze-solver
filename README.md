Things to include:

- multiple exits, or multiple paths to the exit
- randomization rate for ants to sometimes go down paths that don't have the
  most pheromones
- ants keep going until they find the ends

A technical writeup present in the README

A technical appendix, also in the README, containing any additional information
relating to your project (ex: pseudocode, diagrams, proofs that didn’t fit into
writeup sections)

1 - Understand how to implement ACO

- This will give us a deeper understanding of heuristics
- If the algorithm works, we know we’ve understood how to implement it
- If the solution is an optimized solution (finds shortest path) vs just a
  working solution

2 - Understand applications of ACO in other contexts

- Explanation of goal (clarity/why it is a priority)
- If we analyze 2 other contexts and thoroughly explain how the algorithm works
  on the context
- Mid = 1 analysis at minimal level. Mastery = 2 or more in-depth analyses

3 - Compare other heuristics for solving mazes

- Gives us breadth of understanding for maze solving algorithm
- If we analyze two other heuristics and compare / contrast their efficacy in
  solving mazes
- Mid = 1 comparison at minimal level. Mastery = 2 or more comparisons with
  multiple criteria we evaluate on
